# Learning to Learn with STDP

- following the Differentiable Plasticity papers, what if the process of STDP itself is optimized by the outer loop of some learning to learn algorithm?
  - Use BPTT in outer loop
- ~~Use surrogate gradient of the spike (heaviside step) function~~ Maybe later
- Use Tensor Decomposition and Fixed Point Analysis to analyze task representation
